# # Quickstart Guide

# ## Installation
using QuantumCollocationCore

# ## This package also provides various objects and bindings used in Quantum Optimal Control problems.
# This means various common constraints, integrators, objectives, and losses.
# This package also provides interfaces for the commonly needed dynamics, and evaluator objects to provide to the solver - which for now is Ipopt.
